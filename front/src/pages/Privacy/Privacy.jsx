              Processing Methods
              </p>
              <p>
              The Company takes reasonable precautions to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or destruction of the Data. The Data is processed using computers and/or IT-enabled tools, following organizational procedures strictly related to the purposes outlined. Besides the Owner, in some cases, Data may be accessible to specific individuals involved with the operation of    <a className="priv_link" href="http://www.emailsignaturegenerator.ai">
                www.emailsignaturegenerator.ai
              </a> or external parties (such as third-party technical service providers, mail carriers, hosting providers, IT companies, communication agencies) appointed, if necessary, as Data Processors.

              <p>
              Legal Basis of Processing
              </p>
              <p>
              The Owner may process Users' Personal Data if one of the following conditions applies:
              </p>

              <ul  className="privacy_ul">
                <li>Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes.</li>
                <li>Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with the User and/or for any pre-contractual obligations.</li>
                <li>Processing is required to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
                <li>Processing is related to a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the Owner.</li>
            
              </ul>
              <p>Place of Processing</p>
              <p>The Data is processed at the Owner's operating offices and other locations where the parties involved in the processing are based. Depending on the User's location, data transfers may involve transferring the User's Data to a country other than their own.</p>
           <p>
           Users have the right to know the legal basis for Data transfers to a country outside the European Union or to any international organization, as well as the security measures taken by the Owner to safeguard their Data. Users can obtain more information by contacting the Owner.
           </p>
           <p>Retention Period</p>
           <p>Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose it has been collected for:</p>
                <ul  className="privacy_ul">
                    <li>Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a contract shall be retained until the contract has been fully performed.</li>

                </ul>
                <p>The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period if the User has given consent to such processing and as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to do so for compliance with a legal obligation or upon order of an authority.</p>
<p>Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification, and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after the retention period expires.</p>
