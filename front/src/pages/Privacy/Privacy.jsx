              <p>Place of Processing</p>
              <p>The Data is processed at the Owner's operating offices and other locations where the parties involved in the processing are based. Depending on the User's location, data transfers may involve transferring the User's Data to a country other than their own.</p>
           <p>
           Users have the right to know the legal basis for Data transfers to a country outside the European Union or to any international organization, as well as the security measures taken by the Owner to safeguard their Data. Users can obtain more information by contacting the Owner.

Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to do so for compliance with a legal obligation or upon order of an authority.</p>
<p>Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification, and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after the retention period expires.</p>
